I am skilled in all aspects of the full software development cycle, from requirements gathering and planning through development, release, and maintenance. In other words, I can do everything you need to build your app from the ground up and get it on the market which means I can turn your conceptual idea into real working software.

I am a quick learner and I can solve problems related to computers, programming, and mathematics.

I consider myself a team and solo player, I have been involved in any kind of project and a wide variety of roles, I have been coding, managing teams, managing clients and development cycles, and many more.

I believe that communication is the key tool that plays a very important role in any successful project which is why I put a lot of stress on getting requirements straight from my clients. I always try to provide my clients with simple yet efficient solutions that best satisfy their needs.

I pride myself on providing the highest quality of work, and will never complete a project until the client is 100% satisfied.
